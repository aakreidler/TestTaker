# README #
It is an open-source testing app that was built to help a teacher and to provide a learning experience with coding. Because it's open-source it is free. It uses some of the latest technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, and Firebase. However, it is still in beta, so please report any bugs to our github page (open-source development platform). It is for students and teachers.

## TODOS ##
- Put footers inside main content area so that they are responsive
- add tooltips for all buttons
- make dialog for different items
- figure out layout + design
- improve frontend js organization
- write a middleware to check auth instead of doing it each time (be more DRY)

## MILESTONES ##
- Version 1.0 - This is where we are now. We have a basic setup with a backend Node.js API, Mustache for rendering, and Firebase for a database
- Version 2.0 - use front-end frameworks like Angular so we aren't rendering so much on the server (e.g. no more mustache)
- Version 3.0 - flash cards

## To think about ##
- Use a different database like mongodb to have more customization and control
